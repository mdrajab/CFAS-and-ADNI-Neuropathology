# CFAS-and-ADNI-Neuropathology
Feature-feature Correlation Biases Ranking of Dementia Features in Machine Learning Studies (Python Code Scripts)

### Three folders are included along with 4 Python notebook scripts:
1. CFAS and ADNI: the scripts will use this folder to save and create other folders.
2. Dataset: 3 file of datasets are needed upon request by (CFAS and ADNI) + another folder called WEKA that has files for the run from WEKA.
3. Figures: all figures that were produced previously using the code and the data

### The python notebook scripts consist of 4 scripts, where each script does certain tasks:

1.  Pre-processing & Distribution of Neuropathology Features (CFAS & ADNI).

2.  Ranking Neuropathology Features + Difference & Consistency of Filter Methods.

3.  Impute + Correlations Between Pairs of Pathological Features.

4.  Impact of Feature-Feature Correlations on Feature Ranking + Classification.
